# UnityCustomShaders
My custom set of Standard Unity (v5+) shaders as used in my current game
in development: https://twitter.com/hauntedoutbreak

 - The modification of the Standard shader allow to use the alpha channel of
the material albedo texture as occlusion data (grayscale) when using "Opaque"
rendering mode, the modified shader is called "CustomStandard".

 - The modifications of the Standard terrain shaders allow to use a custom
splatmap mix in order to hide ground texture tiling, the modified shader is
called "Nature/Terrain/CustomStandard".
